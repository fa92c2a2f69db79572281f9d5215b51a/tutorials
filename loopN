i = 0 #Where to start loop from
while True: #Loop
        i += 1 #Add 1 to i every time this is executed
        if i > 3: #3 is amount of times we are looping
                break #Break out of loop if it has been executed 3 times.
        #This is where your code goes that will be executed a specified amount of times
        print("Looped!") #Print "Looped"
#Once you have inserted the code to be looped, remove the indent and you can put the rest of your code here. If you don$#code, i'd suggest you check "python threading" on youtube.
